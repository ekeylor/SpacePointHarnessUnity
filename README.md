<h1>Space Point Harness Unity</h1>
<p>This is a Unity 3D test harness for exploring spatial (musical) composition.  
There's a long compositional tradition of stereo audio effects going back to the Gabrielis in Venice (ca. 1600) 
to recent avant-garde composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen (Gr&uuml;ppen, Alphabet f&uuml;r Li&egrave;ge, Sternklang, etc.).  
Game engines like Unity provide new, interesting possibilities for performance, 
especially as mixed reality (augmented reality and virtual reality) technologies become more accessible.</p>

<p>The test harness implements part of a Tonnetz, a network representation of how chords relate by fifths and thirds.</p>

<p>This uses a first person controller, so use the arrow keys and mouse to wander through the Tonnetz.  
Single pitches will shift in the chord that is heard.  Each pitch is played by a different instrument for emphasis.</p>
